Through the team's efforts, each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike Data webpage.## Objective### Step 1 - Find Two Unexpected Phenomena- Aggregate the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs and find two unexpected phenomena.- Design 2-5 visualizations for each discovered phenomena (4-10 total). 	* You may work with a timespan of your choosing. Optionally, you may merge multiple datasets 	   from different periods.### Step 2 - Design a dashboard for each phenomena.- The dashboards should be accompanied with an analysis explaining why the phenomena may	   be occurring.	### Step 3 - Build Maps- A static map that plots all bike stations with a visual indication of the most popular locations to start and end a journey with zip code data overlaid on top### Step 4 - Create a Tableau story- Brings together the visualizations, requested maps, and dashboards.### Analysis## Screen Shots### Step 1 - Interactive D3 chart with all the Risk factors:![Interactive Chart](./Images/D3.js-interactive.gif)## Technologies and Tools* Tableau* Jupyter Notebook	## Code - [Tableau Workbook](/NY Citi Bike Analytics.twbx)## StatusProject Complete## Contact [Divya Shetty](https://github.com/divya-gh)
